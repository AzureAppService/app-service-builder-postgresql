# ShopStream: App Service Builder + Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Fork the [canonical sample](https://github.com/AzureAppService/app-service-builder-postgresql) into your GitHub account.
This integration is not in the Portal template gallery; create an app from your fork and follow the resource setup below.

ShopStream is a React marketplace and operations dashboard backed by Express,
`pg`, and a separately provisioned **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible
Server**. Explore products, vendors, orders, reviews, and analytics. All SQL
queries run server-side using **Microsoft Entra tokens**, never a stored database
password. The default hosted credential is the app's system-assigned managed
identity; local development uses Azure CLI authentication.

**App Service Builder is in Preview. This is a DEV/TEST demo without
application-level visitor authentication, not an e-commerce production system.**
Configure Builder's visitor access policy separately. Database authentication does not
authenticate website visitors. Writes are disabled by default. When explicitly
enabled, every visitor can create orders, advance fulfillment, and create/delete
demo reviews. Do not use real customer data or expose an enabled-write demo to an
untrusted audience.

**Qualification (2026-11-03):** twenty unit tests, local PostgreSQL SQL CRUD/
persistence/privilege checks over verified TLS, frontend packaging, and Edge UI
workflows passed. An explicitly approved DEV/TEST Azure-services firewall
exception enabled Azure bootstrap and least-privilege app-principal mapping.
A hosted Node.js 24/Express deployment then activated: tester-authenticated
`/health` and database reads passed using managed identity and verified TLS;
anonymous root and health requests returned 401. The canonical-origin correction
below also passed hosted qualification: order creation, read-back, one-step
fulfillment, stock decrement, persisted order-item/inventory-event rows, and
review creation/read/deletion. Invalid orders returned 400, insufficient stock
409, and foreign origins and web reset 403. Synthetic rows were removed and
the exact original product values and all seed counts restored.
That mutable hosted test used an internal test-only source upload.
A separate actual **GitHub-source deployment** subsequently passed initial
provisioning, SQL bootstrap/grants, source activation, tester-authenticated
SQL health and seeded reads, default write denial (403), and anonymous
root/health denial (401). All eight baseline table fingerprints were preserved.
Its runtime source was
[`bd1b04d09a6fd48914157f771f48f66b1b2cb184`](https://github.com/seligj95/app-service-builder-postgresql/commit/bd1b04d09a6fd48914157f771f48f66b1b2cb184);
These are historical runtime observations, not qualification of every later
source change. Opt-in CRUD was not repeated in this GitHub-source environment;
post-write hosted app-redeployment persistence remains unverified.
These were approved internal East US 2 Builder / West US 2 PostgreSQL tests,
not qualification of the customer West US 2 Builder target.
Verify your target's identity, grants,
visitor access policy, and permitted network path independently.
No App Service Service Connector, customer VNet integration, private endpoint
route, or stable outbound IP contract is assumed.

For the earlier source-upload test, the 45 hosted runtime source entries match contribution commit
`92c26510e45237af0753bb1f4b6629cdd01a9bf8`; their test source archive SHA256 is
`d5e08379581ca1ee02f7ef4a9cea9223e5db556e77b524d017dfe4efe13d2b4e`.
Privileged `db/` setup was validated separately against Azure and is excluded
from the runtime artifact. Hosted persistence was checked through read-back and
an independent database connection; post-write restart persistence was tested
locally, not repeated in the hosted test.

## Screenshots

### GitHub-source deployment: read-only

These are actual tester-authenticated captures of the GitHub-source runtime
identified above, using Azure PostgreSQL, managed identity, and verified TLS.
Writes remained disabled; these captures do not demonstrate this runtime's
opt-in order/review mutations or post-write redeployment persistence.

### Earlier hosted source-upload test: CRUD

These are actual tester-authenticated Builder runtime captures using Entra-only
Azure PostgreSQL, the app's managed identity, and verified TLS. The order
capture shows the temporary synthetic order after advancing it to processing;
that order and its effects were subsequently cleaned up. Only generated demo
names and `example.com` addresses are shown, not the signed-in tester's identity.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js **24.x** and npm, Git, Azure CLI, and its Bicep component.
- An authorized Azure subscription/tenant, PostgreSQL provisioning rights,
  and an Entra user or group authorized to administer this dedicated database.
- Permission to create and deploy a Builder app with **Node.js 24 support** in **West US 2
  (`westus2`), the customer target region for this sample**; an authorized GitHub
  source repository. Use West US 2 for PostgreSQL as well. Historical East US 2
  test deployments are internal qualification only, not a public region choice.
- A database network path that is explicitly permitted from your workstation
  and, independently, from the deployed Builder app. A laptop connection does
  not qualify the latter.

See the maintained [manifest reference](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/reference/builder-yaml/),
[runtimes](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/reference/runtimes/),
[managed identity guide](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/guides/managed-identity/),
and [service connection checklist](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/guides/connect-to-services/).

## 1. Provision the database dependency

Use a new, dedicated PostgreSQL server and database. The template creates
**Standard_B1ms / Burstable**, PostgreSQL 16, **32 GiB**, seven-day locally
redundant backup, no HA, no automatic storage growth, and **Entra-only**
authentication. It creates no passwords or firewall rules. The public endpoint
is restricted until an explicit permitted IP is added.

Replace placeholders; retain your selected subscription on **every** Azure
command. Do not change the CLI default subscription just for this example.

```sh
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
export RG="<your-owned-devtest-resource-group>"
export PG_SERVER="asb-pg-<globally-unique-suffix>"
export PG_LOCATION="westus2"
export ADMIN_OBJECT_ID="<entra-bootstrap-admin-object-id>"
export ADMIN_NAME="<entra-bootstrap-admin-upn-or-group-name>"

az login --tenant "$AZURE_TENANT_ID"
az account show --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --query '{name:name,tenantId:tenantId}'
az postgres flexible-server list-skus --location "$PG_LOCATION" --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

# Create a dedicated group only if you do not already have an approved one.
az group create --name "$RG" --location "$PG_LOCATION" --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

az deployment group what-if --name asb-pg-dependency --resource-group "$RG" \
  --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters serverName="$PG_SERVER" location="$PG_LOCATION" \
    administratorObjectId="$ADMIN_OBJECT_ID" administratorName="$ADMIN_NAME"

# Review the changes and cost before this creates a billable dependency.
az deployment group create --name asb-pg-dependency --resource-group "$RG" \
  --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters serverName="$PG_SERVER" location="$PG_LOCATION" \
    administratorObjectId="$ADMIN_OBJECT_ID" administratorName="$ADMIN_NAME"
```

Use `administratorType=Group` when your bootstrap administrator is an Entra
group. The runtime managed identity must **not** be this administrator.
Record the deployment's `serverId`, `host`, and `databaseName` outputs.
Region availability is subscription-specific: a SKU listing alone is not a
capacity guarantee.

For an approved workstation connection to **this new test server only**, use
one exact public IPv4, not a broad range. Do not silently substitute the
separate Azure-services exception below or alter unrelated services:

```sh
export BOOTSTRAP_IPV4="<approved-workstation-public-ipv4>"
node -e 'const {isIPv4}=require("node:net"); const ip=process.env.BOOTSTRAP_IPV4; if(!isIPv4(ip)||ip==="0.0.0.0") throw Error("One explicit nonzero IPv4 is required")'
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create --server-name "$PG_SERVER" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name bootstrap-workstation --start-ip-address "$BOOTSTRAP_IPV4" \
  --end-ip-address "$BOOTSTRAP_IPV4" --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

**Stop if Builder cannot reach PostgreSQL under the permitted rules.** Request a
supported preview network path or an explicit DEV/TEST access decision. A
private endpoint does not automatically connect Builder to a VNet.

### Optional, explicitly approved DEV/TEST Azure-source access

The hosted qualification used the PostgreSQL **Allow Azure services** exception,
after explicit approval of its scope. The special `0.0.0.0`–`0.0.0.0` rule allows
Azure-origin workloads **across subscriptions and tenants**, not just your
Builder app or subscription. It is not an all-internet rule, but it is a broad
network admission tradeoff, not narrow production isolation. Entra authentication,
least-privilege SQL mapping, verified TLS, and visitor access controls remain
required. The Bicep template does **not** create this rule.

Only if that scope is approved for your dedicated demo server:

```sh
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule create --server-name "$PG_SERVER" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name devtest-allow-azure-services --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 \
  --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

Keep the exact workstation rule separately. Verify actual bootstrap and
deployed app access: neither a firewall rule nor a laptop test proves hosted
connectivity. If broad Azure-source admission is unacceptable, stop rather than
disable TLS, use a password, make the runtime an administrator, or claim private
networking support.

## 2. Bootstrap schema and demo data as the administrator

```sh
npm ci
export PGHOST="$PG_SERVER.postgres.database.azure.com"
export PGDATABASE=shopstream
export PGUSER="$ADMIN_NAME"
export ENTRA_CREDENTIAL=azure-cli
npm run db:bootstrap
```

The Azure Identity SDK invokes Azure CLI with the explicit subscription,
checks the returned token's tenant against `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, gets the
PostgreSQL audience token, and supplies it through
`pg`'s async password callback. Tokens are never printed or saved. Clear legacy
`DATABASE_URL`, `PGPASSWORD`, and `PGSSLMODE` settings before running: the sample
rejects password/URL authentication and unsafe TLS overrides.

`db/schema.sql` preserves the original eight-table marketplace schema.
`db/seed.sql` installs 10 vendors, 15 categories, 500 products, 200 customers,
300 orders, 900 order items, 400 reviews, and 200 inventory events.
`db/setup.js` wraps schema and seed in one transaction with a shared advisory
lock and a version marker. Bootstrap requires an **empty dedicated database**;
it refuses to merge seed into unrelated tables. Rerunning the command returns
“already installed” without duplicating data or overwriting orders. Do not run
`seed.sql` directly: it relies on fresh IDs and is not independently idempotent.
The seed is synthetic demonstration data, not a reconciled accounting ledger.

To deliberately restore the entire synthetic dataset, stop the demo app first,
connect as the bootstrap administrator, and explicitly confirm the database:

```sh
PGUSER="$ADMIN_NAME" SHOPSTREAM_CONFIRM_RESET="$PGDATABASE" npm run db:reset
```

This replaces **all eight tables' data**, resets sequences, and reseeds within
one transaction. It uses no `CASCADE`. `POST /api/reset` always returns **403**;
the web identity has no `TRUNCATE`, schema ownership, or migration privileges.
Only use reset on this dedicated sample database.

## 3. Create the Builder app and map least-privilege principals

Fork this sample and push your intended branch, including the root
`builder.yaml`. In [Builder Portal](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/),
select your subscription and **Create**. Follow the
[Portal quickstart](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/quickstarts/portal/):
choose **Use my repository**, your fork and branch, and **Let Builder handle it**.
Portal creation uses the repository root.

GitHub sign-in and GitHub App installation are separate requirements. Grant the
official [App Service Builder GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/app-service-builder)
(developer **AzureAppService**) access to **your selected fork**, including
public forks. Review the publisher, owning account, exact repository and OAuth
permissions; do not grant all-repository access merely to deploy this sample.
See the maintained
[GitHub authorization requirements](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/guides/source-control/#github-authorization)
for organization approval and SSO.

In **Access**, enable a **system-assigned identity** and apply required
work-account sign-in. In **App details**, select the same intended subscription,
your approved sample resource group, and **West US 2** for the app. Review these
choices before **Create and deploy**. Record the app's resource ID.
Creating the app requests an initial deployment; it cannot pass the sample's
SQL health check until the variables and principal grants below are in place.
An initial missing-configuration/readiness failure is not a successful serving
deployment. Configure and redeploy this same app; do not create a duplicate.

On the existing app's **Identity** page, record its **principal/object ID**.
If you did not enable the identity during creation, enable it there and choose
**Save and deploy**. Assignment alone grants neither SQL permissions nor network
access. It can be saved before usable build output exists; apply the grants
below before expecting a successful runtime.

On **Authentication**, set **Sign-in** to **Required**, enable
**Microsoft Entra ID**, and use **Limit to specific identities** with the
intended tenant ID and exact tester object IDs. **Save** and **Test sign-in**;
a tenant-only rule permits everyone in that tenant. Review sign-in and
identity-sharing consent personally. Follow the
[authentication guide](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/docs/guides/authentication/)
without weakening access rules to bypass a sign-in failure.

While still connected as the bootstrap administrator:

```sh
export RUNTIME_ROLE=shopstream_runtime
export RUNTIME_OBJECT_ID="<builder-system-assigned-principal-id>"
export RUNTIME_OBJECT_TYPE=service
npm run db:grant
```

`db:grant` connects separately to the **postgres** database to call
`pgaadauth_create_principal_with_oid`, then grants permissions in **shopstream**.
It verifies an existing mapping rather than silently replacing it. Entra
**object IDs** map SQL identities; client IDs select credentials; Azure resource
IDs attach user-assigned identities. They are not interchangeable.

The essential SQL is shown below for review; the script quotes identifiers and
validates inputs. Run the mapping in `postgres` as an Entra administrator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgaadauth_create_principal_with_oid(
  'shopstream_runtime', '<runtime-object-id>', 'service', FALSE, FALSE);
```

Reconnect to `shopstream` as the administrator for the grants:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE shopstream FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE shopstream TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT SELECT ON vendors, categories, products, customers, orders,
  order_items, reviews, inventory_events TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT INSERT ON orders, order_items, reviews, inventory_events TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT UPDATE (stock_qty, rating_avg, review_count, updated_at) ON products TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT UPDATE (status, updated_at) ON orders TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT DELETE ON reviews TO shopstream_runtime;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE orders_id_seq, order_items_id_seq,
  reviews_id_seq, inventory_events_id_seq TO shopstream_runtime;
```

There is no `azure_pg_admin` membership, `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE`, table
ownership, broad default privileges, `TRUNCATE`, or schema write access.
Azure Contributor/Reader roles do **not** grant PostgreSQL data access.
Future schema versions must explicitly review new grants.

For local development, run `db:grant` once more as the administrator with
`RUNTIME_ROLE=shopstream_developer`, your developer user's object ID, and
`RUNTIME_OBJECT_TYPE=user`. Then change **PGUSER** to `shopstream_developer`
before running the web app. Do not run the web app with the admin SQL login.

### User-assigned alternative

Create a separate user-assigned identity in your approved group if you need a
stable identity independent of the app lifecycle:

```sh
az identity create --name asb-pg-runtime --resource-group "$RG" \
  --location "$PG_LOCATION" --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

Attach its returned **resource ID** on Builder's Identity page. Map its
**principal ID** with `db:grant`, and set **AZURE_CLIENT_ID** to its **client ID**
in Builder Variables. Choose **Save and deploy**, and verify the new version.
For the default system-assigned path, leave `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` unset.
The server uses explicit `ManagedIdentityCredential`; it cannot silently fall
back to a developer login or environment client secret when hosted.

## 4. Run and verify locally

Copy `.env.example` to the ignored `.env` and fill the nonsecret connection
settings. Use your limited **developer** SQL role and explicit tenant and
subscription. Environment files are not automatically loaded by npm scripts.

Azure CLI token acquisition accepts either `--subscription` or `--tenant`,
not both. The sample uses the explicit subscription and verifies tenant
selection from the trusted SDK token output; `az login --tenant` selects the
intended directory before you run it.

```sh
export PGUSER=shopstream_developer
npm test
npm run build
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8186 node --env-file=.env server/index.js
```

Existing shell variables take precedence over `--env-file`; the explicit
`PGUSER` change prevents the earlier bootstrap administrator from leaking into
the local web process. Keep `.env` consistent with the same limited role.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8186` in Microsoft Edge. `/health` queries PostgreSQL and
returns **200** only when connectivity/authentication succeed, otherwise **503**.
The dashboard, products, vendors, and analytics must display actual seeded
database rows; a rendered shell alone is not verification.

To exercise mutations in this isolated demo, stop the server, add
`SHOPSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_WRITES=true` to `.env`, and restart. Orders exposes
**Place Test Order** and one-step fulfillment actions; product details exposes
review creation/deletion. Errors are displayed rather than reported as success.
Leave `SHOPSTREAM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` unset for direct local development: browser
origins must match the request's actual scheme, host, and port.

An API-level CRUD/persistence walkthrough (requires opt-in writes):

```sh
export APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8186
curl --fail "$APP_URL/health"
curl --fail "$APP_URL/api/products?limit=2"
curl --fail -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"customer_id":1,"items":[{"product_id":1,"quantity":1}]}' "$APP_URL/api/orders"
# Replace <order-id> with the response ID; read and update that same row.
curl --fail "$APP_URL/api/orders/<order-id>"
curl --fail -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"processing"}' "$APP_URL/api/orders/<order-id>"
curl --fail -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"product_id":1,"customer_id":1,"rating":5,"title":"Demo persistence review"}' "$APP_URL/api/reviews"
# Product read shows the new review and updated aggregate; delete only its returned ID.
curl --fail "$APP_URL/api/products/1"
curl --fail -X DELETE "$APP_URL/api/reviews/<review-id>"
```

Restart the app and read the same order ID: its status must remain `processing`
and product stock must remain decremented. Orders, stock, items, and inventory
events commit atomically. Duplicate product IDs are combined; row locks prevent
overselling. Quantities are integers 1–100, at most 20 product lines, and totals
are bounded. Transactions share an advisory lock across replicas. Demo limits:
**1,000 orders, 1,000 reviews, 5,000 inventory events** (including seed).
Reaching a limit returns **409**, never auto-resets or deletes data.

Integration tests require a real seeded PostgreSQL database and an explicitly
confirmed dedicated test target; see `test/integration/crud.test.js`. They create
one order, advance its status, and create/delete their own review. With your
limited developer login and a disposable seeded target in `.env`, run:

```sh
SHOPSTREAM_INTEGRATION_DB=shopstream node --env-file=.env --test test/integration/crud.test.js
```

The order and stock change intentionally remain for process-restart assertions;
restore the dedicated dataset through the administrator-only reset above when
finished, not through the web app. No production fallback or in-memory database
is used.

## 5. Deploy your committed source with Builder

Return to the app created in step 3. Verify its connected fork, committed branch
and repository root under **Settings → Source Control**. Keep **Automatic
deployments** off under **Settings → Deployment Settings**: native push delivery
and the **Use GitHub Actions** approach are not available in this preview.
Push a reviewed commit, then deploy explicitly. Do not point Builder at the
original legacy deployment manifest.

The root `builder.yaml` declares exactly one **web** component, Node.js **24**,
`run.start: node server/index.js`, and health path `/health`. It retains the
default port **8080** and mount `/`. The root package contains only the Express/
PostgreSQL backend dependencies. Vite, React, its config, and its own lockfile
live under **client/**. This separation is important: a root Vite dependency or
config can classify the root as Vite and reject `role: web`/`run`, even with a
custom build. The **explicit custom compute build** is:

```text
npm ci && npm run build && npm run package
```

The root build script installs the locked client dependencies and builds the
frontend from `client/` into root `dist/`; the root has no Vite framework
evidence. Do not move the frontend dependencies/config back to the root.
The packaging script stages `server`, `dist`, installed dependencies, and
package metadata under Builder's **$DESTINATION_DIR**. The runnable artifact is
self-contained; it does not require source-relative `../client`, database
bootstrap scripts, or a privileged build-time connection. There is no static
`output`, legacy `dependencies`, automatic database migration, or
`startCommand` field. Never set reserved `PORT` in Builder Variables.

Set these runtime variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `PGHOST` | The provisioned server FQDN |
| `PGDATABASE` | `shopstream` |
| `PGUSER` | `shopstream_runtime`, mapped to the actual runtime identity |
| `ENTRA_CREDENTIAL` | `managed-identity` (also the default) |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Unset for system-assigned; client ID for user-assigned |
| `SHOPSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_WRITES` | Unset/false initially; true only for a bounded trusted demo |
| `SHOPSTREAM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | For enabled hosted writes, the exact public HTTPS origin, for example `https://your-app.app.westus2.builderapps.dev` |

Builder's proxy uses an internal routing Host, so enabled hosted browser writes
need `SHOPSTREAM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` set to the actual runtime URL's **origin**. Use
no trailing slash, path, query, fragment, credentials, or wildcard. Invalid
configuration fails explicitly at startup; HTTP is accepted only for loopback
development. Browser Origin must match the configured scheme, hostname, and
port exactly. Forwarded host/protocol headers are not trusted. This setting
does not enable writes or authenticate visitors; keep writes disabled unless
the demo audience is trusted and the app's access policy is appropriate.
For tester-only validation, enforce Builder's required Entra visitor policy
before enabling writes. Review any sign-in or application-consent prompt
personally; database managed identity does not replace visitor access control.

Use the app's **Variables** page, then choose **Save and deploy** to capture variables in a new version. **Save only**
does not update running code. Retained versions use historical settings. Wait
for successful deployment and inspect the active version's exact GitHub source
revision. Open **Overview → Browse**, sign in as an allowed tester, and check
the **actual runtime URL**: `/health` must return 200 with `status: healthy`,
and dashboard/products/orders must read seeded database rows. Before enabling
writes, verify an order POST is denied with 403 and an anonymous root/health
request is denied with 401. A protected health endpoint returning 401 to an
anonymous client is not a database failure; check it in the authenticated
browser instead. Do not export session cookies or redeploy merely to finish
sign-in.

For a separately approved bounded mutation test, set
`SHOPSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_WRITES=true` and `SHOPSTREAM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the exact
runtime origin in Variables, **Save and deploy**, then use the UI to create one
test order, advance it once to processing, and create/read/delete one review.
Record the returned IDs. Use the same signed-in browser for API checks; the
local unauthenticated curl walkthrough is not an authenticated hosted recipe.
Deploy a reviewed subsequent version and read the same order ID to test
post-redeployment persistence. Restore `SHOPSTREAM_ENABLE_DEMO_WRITES=false` with **Save and deploy**
after testing. These are customer verification steps, not claims that all were
repeated in the historical GitHub-source qualification above.
Successful authenticated checks qualify deployed managed identity and network access.
The CI workflow runs local tests/build only; it does not deploy or bootstrap.

## Authentication, TLS, errors, and troubleshooting

`server/db/config.js` passes the async password function to `pg`, which invokes
it for **each new physical connection**, including connections created after
token expiry. The SDK manages caching/refresh; existing connections are not
re-authenticated per query. Pool size is five, idle timeout 30 seconds,
connection timeout 15 seconds, query/statement deadlines are bounded, and
connections rotate after 30 minutes. SQL mutations are never automatically
retried: a lost commit response needs reconciliation, not duplicate orders.

TLS always uses **rejectUnauthorized: true**, with hostname verification and
Node's trusted CA roots. If your documented CA requirements need a custom
bundle, set **PGSSLROOTCERT** to its server-side PEM path; that bundle must be
present in the runtime artifact. Never use `sslmode=require` as a substitute
for certificate verification, `rejectUnauthorized: false`, or
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`.

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Missing configuration at startup | Supply PGHOST/PGDATABASE/PGUSER; remove legacy URL/password/TLS overrides |
| Local credential failure | Correct `az login`, explicit tenant/subscription, `ENTRA_CREDENTIAL=azure-cli` |
| Hosted credential failure | Identity is deployed; correct AZURE_CLIENT_ID selection; preview credential delivery support |
| Role does not exist/token rejected | Map principal in `postgres`, verify object ID, SQL PGUSER, tenant, and PostgreSQL audience |
| Permission denied | Runtime grants in `shopstream`, not just ARM roles or another database |
| DNS/timeout | Approved network path and firewall; do not weaken restrictions to mask failure |
| Connection resets before TLS | Investigate the permitted transport path independently of token/password selection; server Ready and matching firewall rules do not prove SQL/TLS reachability |
| TLS certificate error | FQDN and supported trusted CA bundle; never disable verification |
| 403 on mutations | Check the demo-write opt-in and exact SHOPSTREAM_PUBLIC_ORIGIN behind a proxy; foreign origins and web reset remain forbidden |
| 409 | Stock, fulfillment transition, or bounded dataset limit; reconcile before retry |
| Saved settings have no effect | Deploy a new version and verify its variables, identity, and active source |
| Build succeeds, activation fails | Confirm Node.js compute support for this Builder target |
| AppStartupFailed/readiness timeout | Inspect the exact startup/deployment diagnostics and `/health`; successful build or process start is not database or serving qualification |

Server logs include request path and error **code/name**, not tokens, full
connection strings, raw PostgreSQL error details, or customer payloads.
Client dependency errors return a bounded **503** with troubleshooting context.
Graceful shutdown closes HTTP and database pools.

## Costs and cleanup

Check [PostgreSQL pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/postgresql/flexible-server/)
for West US 2 and your agreement before provisioning. An illustrative West US 2
retail lookup on 2026-11-03 returned **B1MS $0.017/hour** and managed storage
**$0.115/GiB-month**: approximately **$16.09/month** for 730 compute hours and
32 GiB, excluding excess backups, transfer, taxes, and Builder charges.
This is not a quote or a zero-cost guarantee. B1ms has limited CPU credits and
memory; use this bounded dataset rather than a million-row seed.

Stop local processes with Ctrl+C. When finished, delete only the owned Builder
sample app through Portal and confirm deletion. App deletion does **not**
delete PostgreSQL or a user-assigned identity. If retaining the database, reset
only this dedicated synthetic dataset as described above if needed.
After separately approving dependency cleanup, remove the workstation firewall
rule while the server still exists:

```sh
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule delete --server-name "$PG_SERVER" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name bootstrap-workstation --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

If you explicitly enabled the DEV/TEST Azure-services exception, remove that
specific rule when finished as well. This can stop the demo's database access:

```sh
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule delete --server-name "$PG_SERVER" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name devtest-allow-azure-services --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

If deleting the dedicated database server, this removes its databases, SQL
roles and all demo data. Delete the optional user-assigned identity only if it
was created solely for this sample:

```sh
az postgres flexible-server delete --name "$PG_SERVER" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
# Only if you created this optional identity for the sample:
az identity delete --name asb-pg-runtime --resource-group "$RG" \
  --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
```

Do **not** delete a shared resource group, unrelated resources, or source forks
as incidental cleanup. Record all sample-created IDs and remove them explicitly.
Deleting a system-assigned app identity does not automatically remove its SQL
mapping: revoke/drop the unused role as an administrator if reusing the server.
